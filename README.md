# Overlapping Speech ASR + LLM Project

This repository contains a reproducible experiment suite for overlapping
Mandarin speech recognition. It compares direct ASR, speaker diarization,
speech separation, and constrained LLM/RAG transcript refinement on a controlled
two-speaker debate dataset.

## Research Question

When two speakers overlap, which pipeline produces the most useful transcript?

The current experiment compares five paths:

1. `direct_asr`: transcribe mixed audio directly.
2. `diarization_asr`: transcribe full mixed audio, then align speaker labels.
3. `diarization_turn_asr`: diarize first, then transcribe each speaker turn.
4. `separation_asr`: separate speakers first, then transcribe each stream.
5. `llm_rag_refine`: use project context to clean ASR outputs without inventing
   missing words.

## Current Status

The main server run is complete for five Mandarin `sample2` conditions:

- no overlap
- light overlap
- medium overlap
- heavy overlap
- opposite-order overlap

The final comparison config is
`overlap_asr_llm/configs/all_pipelines.json`. It uses:

- ASR: `whisper:large-v3`
- Diarization: `pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`
- Separation: `clearvoice:MossFormer2_SS_16K`
- LLM/RAG: OpenAI-compatible `api` provider

Headline results from `outputs/all_pipelines/run_summary.md` and
`outputs/all_pipelines/readability_summary.md`:

- Best average CER/WER and TRS text: `diarization_asr`, avg CER `0.1532`,
  avg WER `0.1563`, avg TRS text `85.8221`.
- Fastest pipeline: `direct_asr`, avg runtime `6.72s`.
- Best no-overlap row: `diarization_turn_asr`, CER `0.0094`.
- Best opposite-overlap row: `separation_asr`, CER `0.0632`, WER `0.0769`,
  TRS text `89.0998`.
- LLM/RAG improves readability on light, medium, and heavy overlap, but should
  be reported as constrained cleanup rather than reliable recovery of missing
  speech.

## Quick Start

For team members, the Chinese quick start is:
`overlap_asr_llm/docs/QUICK_START_FOR_TEAM_CN.md`

Run the local mock pipeline first. It uses only lightweight mock providers and
is meant to verify that the repository works:

```bash
cd overlap_asr_llm
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/mock.json --mock
```

The command writes:

- `outputs/mock/results.json`
- `outputs/mock/results.csv`
- `outputs/mock/run_summary.md`

You can also run the stdlib smoke test:

```bash
python3 scripts/smoke_test.py
```

## Installation

The mock pipeline only needs Python 3.10+ and the source tree. For editable
development:

```bash
cd overlap_asr_llm
pip install -e .
```

For real-model experiments, install the full optional stack:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

Real ASR, diarization, separation, and readability evaluation may require GPU
memory, large model downloads, and API credentials.

## Running Experiments

Run the current final comparison:

```bash
cd overlap_asr_llm
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/all_pipelines.json --incremental
```

Run a single pipeline config:

```bash
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/direct_asr.json --incremental
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/diarization_asr.json --incremental
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/separation_asr.json --incremental
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli run --config configs/speaker_llm_pipeline.json --incremental
```

Run post-hoc readability evaluation after a result JSON exists:

```bash
python3 -m overlap_asr_llm.cli evaluate \
  --config configs/all_pipelines.json \
  --results outputs/all_pipelines/results.json \
  --device auto \
  --batch-size 1
```

The evaluator writes `readability_results.csv`,
`readability_results.json`, and `readability_summary.md` beside the input
`results.json`.

## Providers

Supported provider values:

- ASR: `mock`, `whisper`, `whisper:<model-name>`,
  `faster-whisper`, `faster-whisper:<model-name>`, `funasr`
- Diarization: `mock`, `pyannote`, `pyannote:<huggingface-model-id>`,
  `speechbrain`, `speechbrain:<huggingface-model-id>`
- Separation: `mock`, `sepformer`, `sepformer:<huggingface-model-id>`,
  `clearvoice`, `clearvoice:<model-name>`
- LLM/RAG refinement: `mock`, `api`, `api:<model-name>`

The `--mock` flag deliberately forces all providers to mock mode. Real LLM/RAG
refinement uses the OpenAI-compatible `api` provider and requires
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. Optional `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` environment
variables are also supported.

## Metrics

The runner reports:

- CER and WER
- runtime
- speaker labels and segment exports
- `flat_cer` / `flat_wer`
- `timeline_cer` / `timeline_wer`
- `speaker_block_cer` / `speaker_block_wer`
- primary `cer` / `wer` selected by `score_basis`

Metric variants:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `flat_cer` / `flat_wer` | Compare the flattened transcript text against the flattened reference. Speaker labels and timing are not the focus. |
| `timeline_cer` / `timeline_wer` | Sort output segments by timestamp, concatenate their text, then compare against the reference timeline. |
| `speaker_block_cer` / `speaker_block_wer` | Group text by speaker first, try the best mapping between predicted speaker labels and reference speakers, then compare speaker blocks. This is useful because diarization labels can be swapped, e.g. predicted `SPEAKER_00` may correspond to reference `speaker_2`. |
| `cer` / `wer` | The primary score selected for that row by `score_basis`; it may use timeline or speaker-block scoring depending on the pipeline output. |

Lower CER/WER values are better. `speaker_block` means "compare by speaker's
whole content block", not "compare by chronological turn". It rewards systems
that keep each speaker's words together even if the arbitrary speaker label
names are reversed.

The readability evaluator adds:

- BERTScore precision, recall, F1, and F2
- text-only TRS
- speaker-aware TRS where speaker segments are available
- overlap ratio reporting
- high-overlap review notes

TRS, or True Readability Score, is an exploratory reporting formula for this
project rather than a published standard metric. The motivation is that CER/WER
alone can miss whether a transcript is actually useful under overlap: a system
may have decent edit distance while dropping a speaker's clause, mixing speaker
turns, or adding unsupported cleanup. The current text-only version combines
character accuracy with recall-weighted semantic coverage:

$$
\mathrm{TRS}_{text}
=
100
\times
\sqrt{
\left(1-\min(\mathrm{CER},1)\right)
\times
F_{2,\mathrm{BERT}}
}
$$

For speaker-attributed outputs, the speaker-aware version adds speaker-block
accuracy:

$$
\mathrm{TRS}_{speaker}
=
100
\times
\sqrt[3]{
\left(1-\min(\mathrm{CER},1)\right)
\times
F_{2,\mathrm{BERT}}
\times
\left(1-\min(\mathrm{SpeakerBlockCER},1)\right)
}
$$

This geometric-mean design keeps the formula simple and makes one weak
dimension lower the final score, which matches the project goal: a transcript
should be accurate, semantically faithful, and speaker-readable at the same
time. The full motivation, component definitions, and interpretation notes are
in `overlap_asr_llm/docs/TRUE_READABILITY_SCORE.md`.
